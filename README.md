# minity - A minimal graphics engine


## Getting Started

Minity was developed under Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. It uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system and does not contain anything else platform-specific, so it should in principle work using other compilers and operating systems, but this has not been tested. Should there be any issues, we are grateful for any input that helps us make the software work on as many platforms as possible.

## Prerequisites

The project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and relies on the following libraries: 

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) 3.3 or higher (https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git) for windowing and input support
- [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/) 0.9.9.5 or higher (https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git) for its math funtionality
- [glbinding](https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding) 3.1.0 or higher (https://github.com/cginternals/glbinding.git) for OpenGL API binding
- [globjects](https://github.com/cginternals/globjects) 2.0.0 or higher (https://github.com/cginternals/globjects.git) for additional OpenGL wrapping
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) 1.71 or higher (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git) for GUI elements
- [tinyfiledialogs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/) 3.3.9 or higher (https://git.code.sf.net/p/tinyfiledialogs/code) for dialog functionality
- [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb/) (stb_image.h 2.22 or higher and stb_image_write.h 1.13 or higher) or higher (https://github.com/nothings/stb.git) for image loading and saving

The release package includes all these libraries in compiled form (where applicable), so if you are using it you can skip the remainder of the section.

### Windows
If you want or need to compile the dependencies yourself, on Windows we provide a set of batch scripts to simplify the process of retrieving and building them. These scripts require that the Git and CMake executables properly set up and in your system path.

- ```./fetch-libs.cmd``` retrieves the libraries from their respective git repositories.  
- ```./build-libs.cmd``` builds them and installs them into the ```./lib``` folder.  
- ```./copy-libs.cmd``` copies DLLs required for execution into the ```./bin/Debug``` and ```./bin/Release``` folders. 

After opening a command prompt and running these three scripts from the project root folder, all dependencies should be available in the ```./lib``` folder.

```
./fetch-libs.cmd
./build-libs.cmd
./copy-libs.cmd
```

On other platforms, as Dear ImGui, and tinyfiledialogs, and stb do not use CMake, place them as subfolders of the ```./lib``` folder (using the folder names ```imgui```, ```tinyfd```, and ```stb```):

```
cd lib
git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git  
git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/tinyfiledialogs/code tinyfd
git clone https://github.com/nothings/stb.git
cd ..
```

The other libraries use CMake, so just follow their respective instructions and make sure that your CMake installation can find them.

### Linux
We also provide a set of similar scripts for linux-based distributions:
 - `./linux-fetch-libs.sh` retrieves the libraries from their respective git repositories
 - `./linux-build-libs.sh` builds them and installs them into the `./lib` folder 

[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) also requires a few dependencies. [See their documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/compile.html#compile_deps) for how to install the dependencies for the respective platform.

First fetch all the required libraries manually or using the `./linux-fetch-libs.sh` script (requires Git to be installed). If you don't have a C++ compiler installed, you can install GCC and a debugger using:
```
sudo apt install build-essential gdb
```
Before building you might have to specify which C++ compiler you would like to use, which you can do by exporting the CXX variable. 

Example using (GCC's C++ compiler):
```
export CXX=g++
```

Finally, if CMake (version 3.8 or higher) is installed, you can build the libraries by running the `./linux-build-libs.sh` script.

## Building
If building from the command line, run the following commands from the project root folder to setup the CMake configurations:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

After this, you can compile the debug or release versions of the project using 

```
cmake --build --config Debug
```

and/or

```
cmake --build --config Release
```

After building, the executables will be available in the ```./bin/Debug``` and ```./bin/Release``` folders.

## Running

The program requires that the current working directory is set to the project root folder. On Windows, the program further assumes that the DLLs for glfw, glbinding, and globjects are located in the same folder as the executable (or, alternatively, are in the system path). If you followed the steps above, this should already be the case. Otherwise, you can run the copy-libs.cmd script to copy them over from the ```./lib``` folder. When running the program from outside an IDE, you can use the ```./minity.cmd``` script in the project root folder to run the software from the top directory.

### Visual Studio
If you are using Visual Studio 2019, you can use its integrated CMake support to build and run the project. When running the program from within the IDE, make sure the current working directory is set to the project root in ```./.vs/launch.vs.json``` file by including ```"currentDir": "${projectDir}â€œ```, so that all resources can be found by the executable.

### Visual Studio Code
If using Visual Studio Code and the [CMake Tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) you can setup a debugger by generating any default launch config (by pressing the debug button) and changing the `program` variable to the macro:
```json
"program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}"
```
**Windows**: The default behavior of the extension is to put built binaries in an additional target folder, so if running on Windows you will have to move the dll-files into `./bin/Debug` and `./bin/Release`.

### CLion
CLion has arguably the easiest setup for CMake based projects like Minity, so you don't have to do much here. When running the program however, CMake might fail to set the correct working directory which may gives errors like "failed to locate font" or "failed to load shader" in the console. To fix these errors, go to *Run* -> *Configurations* and set the working directory to the top folder. If the project folder is the same as the repository folder, you can simply use the `$ProjectFileDir$` macro.

## Usage

After starting the program, a file dialog will pop up and ask you for a Wavefront OBJ File file. Some basic usage instructions are displayed in the console window.
